# CIS262AD - C# Level II - Fall 2018
## Rio Salado Community College 
This code is being posted as a learning aid. Taking this class I realized it was challenging to learn by only communicating with the teacher via email. This was compounded by the fact that at best the turnaround time to receive a reply was 24 hours on weekday, and usually longer than that. I received an A on every assignment thus an overall A in the class. Use this code to learn if you're stuck, it was quite the experience to figure all of this out for CIS262AD C# II at Rio Salado Community College.
